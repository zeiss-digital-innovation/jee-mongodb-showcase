### GPX POI Import folder

You can place GPX files in this directory.

Every found waypoint in these files will be imported with a POST request to the backend.

All waypoints here will be imported with category `post` (i.e. a post office).

You can get POI data here: [POI plaza](http://poiplaza.com/).
